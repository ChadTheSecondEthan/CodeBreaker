Sometimes we make the process more complicated than we need to. We will never make a journey of a thousand miles by fretting about how long it will take or how hard it will be. We make the journey by taking each day step by step and then repeating it again and again until we reach our destination.
Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth.
Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.
Don’t walk in front of me… I may not follow. Don’t walk behind me… I may not lead. Walk beside me… just be my friend.
Friendship ... is born at the moment when one man says to another, "What! You too? I thought that no one but myself..."
I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
